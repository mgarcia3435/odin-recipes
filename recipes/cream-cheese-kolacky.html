    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A kolacky is a bite-sized pastry with Czech origins. The rich dough (which is made with cream cheese, butter, and flour) can feature different fillings, but jam is one of the most popular choices.</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Mix cream cheese and butter together in a bowl until smooth.</li>
